            When a user inputs either rock, papers, or scissors. A function
            will randomly return rock, papers, or scissors.

            If the computer wins then it should print "You lose! 'x' beats 'y'" 
            If the user wins, it should print "You win 'x' beats 'y'"           
        
            The users input should be case-insensitive
